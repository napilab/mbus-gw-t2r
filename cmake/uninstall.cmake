#	FACILITY: A yet another gateway for MODBUS (TCP to RTU)
#
#	DESCRIPTION: The <uninstall> target helper: removes every file which is listed in the
#		install_manifest.txt of the current build directory. The configuration files which
#		were kept intact at the installation time are not listed there - so a has been
#		tuned working configuration survives the uninstallation.
